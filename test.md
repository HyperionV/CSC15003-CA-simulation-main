# CA Management System - Phase 2.2 Testing Report

## Implemented Features

Phase 2.2 has implemented the Client Console UI with the following features:

1. **Authentication**
   - Login functionality
   - User registration
   - Logout functionality

2. **Certificate Operations**
   - Certificate request generation
   - View existing certificates
   - Certificate revocation
   - Certificate download

3. **User Interface**
   - Clean console-based UI with menus and prompts
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Clear status messages and feedback

4. **Server Communication Simulation**
   - JSON-based request/response format
   - Simulated server responses for testing

## How to Test

### Building the Project

1. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Generate the build files and compile:
```
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

3. Run the client application:
```
./ca_client
```

### Testing Authentication

1. **Login**
   - Select option 1 from the Authentication menu
   - Enter username "admin" and password "admin" (these are the simulated credentials)
   - You should see a successful login message
   - Try an invalid username/password combination to test error handling

2. **Register**
   - Select option 2 from the Authentication menu
   - Enter a username, password, and email
   - You should see a successful registration message
   - Note: In the current simulation, all registrations succeed

3. **Logout**
   - After logging in, select option 5 from the Certificate menu
   - You should see a successful logout message and return to the Authentication menu

### Testing Certificate Operations

1. **Request Certificate**
   - Login first
   - Select option 1 from the Certificate menu
   - Enter the required information (Common Name, Organization, Country)
   - The application will generate a key pair and a certificate signing request
   - You should see a message indicating the request was submitted successfully
   - Check that a .key file was created with the private key

2. **View Certificates**
   - Login first
   - Select option 2 from the Certificate menu
   - You should see a table of certificates (currently showing simulated data)

3. **Revoke Certificate**
   - Login first
   - Select option 3 from the Certificate menu
   - The application will show your certificates
   - Enter the ID of a certificate to revoke (try with ID 1 from the simulated data)
   - Enter a reason for revocation
   - You should see a message indicating successful revocation

4. **Download Certificate**
   - Login first
   - Select option 4 from the Certificate menu
   - The application will show your certificates
   - Enter the ID of a certificate to download (try with ID 1 from the simulated data)
   - You should see a message indicating the certificate was downloaded
   - Check that a .pem file was created with the certificate data

## Notes

- The server communication is currently simulated for testing purposes
- Successful login is hardcoded to username "admin" and password "admin"
- The certificate list, revocation, and download all use simulated data
- Files are saved in the current working directory

## Known Limitations

- The implementation uses a simulated server, so no actual server communication takes place
- No persistent storage for client data (except for the key/certificate files saved during operations)
- Screen clearing uses "cls" command which is Windows-specific (will not work correctly on Linux/Mac)
